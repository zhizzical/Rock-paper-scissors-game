#  Rock Paper Scissors – Java Edition 🪨📜✂️
A simple yet competitive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Java. Play against a ruthless (okay, slightly random) AI and test your luck!

## How It Works?
* Choose rock, paper, or scissors—type it in and hit enter.
* The computer picks its move at random.
* The game announces who wins or if it’s a tie.
* Want to play again? Just say "yes" or "no."
* Enter "exit" anytime to quit like a boss.

## Features
* Fully interactive game loop
* Input validation (no cheating with "fireball")
* Randomized AI opponent
* Option to replay or exit

## Future upgrades? (stay tuned!)
